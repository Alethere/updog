\arguments{
\item{refvec}{A vector of counts of reads with the reference allele.}

\item{sizevec}{A vector of total counts.}

\item{ploidy}{The ploidy of the species. Assumed to be the same for each
individual.}

\item{model}{What form should the prior (genotype distribution) take?
See Details for possible values.}

\item{verbose}{Should we output more (\code{TRUE}) or less
(\code{FALSE})?}

\item{mean_bias}{The prior mean of the log-bias.}

\item{var_bias}{The prior variance of the log-bias.}

\item{mean_seq}{The prior mean of the logit of the sequencing
error rate.}

\item{var_seq}{The prior variance of the logit of the sequencing
error rate.}

\item{seq}{The starting value of the sequencing error rate.}

\item{bias}{The starting value of the bias.}

\item{od}{The starting value of the overdispersion parameter.}

\item{update_bias}{A logical. Should we update \code{bias}
(\code{TRUE}), or not (\code{FALSE})?}

\item{update_seq}{A logical. Should we update \code{seq}
(\code{TRUE}), or not (\code{FALSE})?}

\item{update_od}{A logical. Should we update \code{od}
(\code{TRUE}), or not (\code{FALSE})?}

\item{mode}{The mode if \code{model = "ash"}. If not provided,
\code{flexdog} will estimate the mode. This is the starting point of
the allele frequency if \code{model = "hw"}. This should be
\code{NULL} for all other options of \code{model}.}

\item{use_cvxr}{A logical. If \code{model = "ash"}, then do you want
to use the EM algorithm
(\code{FALSE}) or a convex optimization program using
the package CVXR \code{TRUE}?
Only available if CVXR is installed. Setting \code{use_cvxr} to
\code{TRUE} is generally slower than setting it to \code{FALSE}.}

if the difference in the log-likelihoods between two consecutive
iterations is less than \code{tol}.}

\item{fs1_alpha}{The value at which to fix
the mixing proportion for the uniform compnent
 when \code{model = "f1"} or
\code{model = "s1"}. I would recommend some small

\code{model = "f1"}, or for the only parent if \code{model = "s1"}.}

\code{model = "f1"}.}

\item{p2size}{The total counts for the second parent if
\code{model = "f1"}.}

\item{outliers}{A logical. Should we allow for the inclusion of outliers
(\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). Only supported when
\code{model = "f1"} or \code{model = "s1"}. I wouldn't
recommend it for any other model anyway.}

\description{
Genotype polyploid individuals from next generation
sequencing (NGS) data while assuming the genotype distribution is one of
several forms. \code{flexdog} does this while accounting for allele bias,
overdispersion, sequencing error, and possibly outlying observations
(if \code{model = "f1"} or \code{model = "s1"}).
}
\details{
Possible values of the genotype distribution (values of \code{model}) are:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"hw"}}{A binomial distribution that results from assuming that
      the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). This actually does
      pretty well even when there are minor to moderate deviations from HWE.}
  \item{\code{"bb"}}{A beta-binomial distribution. This is a overdispersed
      version of "hw" and can be derived from a special case of the Balding-Nichols model.}
  \item{\code{"norm"}}{A distribution whose genotype frequencies are proportional
      to the density value of a normal with some mean and some standard deviation.
      Unlike the "bb" option, this will allow for distributions less dispersed than a binomial.}
  \item{\code{"ash"}}{Any unimodal prior. This will run \code{ploidy} EM algorithms
      with a different center during each optimization. It returns the center (and its fit)
      with the highest likelihood.}
  \item{\code{"f1"}}{This prior assumes the individuals are all full-siblings resulting
      from one generation of a bi-parental cross. Since this is a pretty strong
      and well-founded prior, we allow \code{outliers = TRUE} when \code{model = "f1"}.}
  \item{\code{"s1"}}{This prior assumes the individuals are all full-siblings resulting
      from one generation of selfing. I.e. there is only one parent.
      Since this is a pretty strong and well-founded prior,
      we allow \code{outliers = TRUE} when \code{model = "s1"}.}
  \item{\code{"flex"}}{Generically any categorical distribution. This works well if
      you have a lot of individuals, and so is the default. Though we
      recommend \code{model = "norm"} (and provide a warning concerning this)
      if you have too few individuals.}
  \item{\code{"uniform"}}{A discrete uniform distribution. This should never
      be used in practice. Please don't email me that \code{flexdog} doesn't
      work if you use this option.}
}

You might think a good default is \code{model = "uniform"} because it is
somehow an "uninformative prior." But it is very informative and tends to
work horribly in practice. The intuition is that it will estimate
the allele bias and sequencing error rates so that the estimated genotypes
are approximately uniform (since we are assuming that they are approximately
uniform). This will usually result in unintuitive genotyping since most
populations don't have a uniform genotype distribution.
I include it as an option only for completeness. Please, please don't use it.

Generally, good defaults are to use \code{model = "flex"} if you have
a lot of individuals (say, \eqn{> 10 * (ploidy + 1)}) and
\code{model = "norm"} if you do not have a lot of individuals
(say, \eqn{< 10 * (ploidy + 1)}). This is if you use
multiple initializations of the bias as is the default
in \code{\link{flexdog}}.

The value of \code{prop_mis} is a very intuitive measure for
the quality of the SNP. \code{prop_mis} is the posterior
proportion of individuals mis-genotyped. So if you want to
accurately genotype, say, 95\% of the individuals, you could
discard all SNPs with a \code{prop_mis} under \code{0.95}.

The value of \code{maxpostprob} is a very intuitive measure
for the quality of the genotype estimate of an individual.
This is the posterior probability of correctly genotyping
the individual when using \code{ogeno} (the posterior mode)
as the genotype estimate.

In most datasets I've examined, allelic bias is a major issue. However,
you may fit the model assuming no allelic bias by setting
\code{update_bias = FALSE} and \code{bias_init = 1}.

Prior to using \code{flexdog}, during the read-mapping step,
you could try to get rid of allelic bias by
using WASP (\url{https://doi.org/10.1101/011221}). If you are successful
in removing the allelic bias (because its only source was the read-mapping
step), then setting \code{update_bias = FALSE} and \code{bias_init = 1}
would be reasonable. You can visually inspect SNPs for bias by
using \code{\link{plot_geno}}.

\code{flexdog}, like most methods, is invariant to which allele you
label as the "reference" and which you label as the "alternative".
That is, if you set \code{refvec} with the number of alternative
read-counts, then the resulting genotype estimates
will be the estimated allele dosage of the alternative allele.
