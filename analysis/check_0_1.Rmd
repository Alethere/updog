# Abstract

I check if the new overdispersion parameter is always less than 1.

# Analysis

The modified Schur function
```{r}
library(assertthat)
schur_mod <- function(R, K) {
  n <- ncol(R)
  assertthat::are_equal(nrow(R), n)
  assertthat::assert_that(K > 1)
  R11 <- R[1, 1, drop = FALSE]
  R12 <- R[1, 2:n, drop = FALSE]
  R21 <- R[2:n, 1, drop = FALSE]
  R22 <- R[2:n, 2:n, drop = FALSE]
  R11 - R12 %*% solve(diag(x = 1 / (K - 1), nrow = n - 1, ncol = n - 1) + R22) %*% R21
}
```


First, I'll try out the most extreme R I can think of

```{r}
R <- matrix(1, nrow = 11, ncol = 11)
schur_mod(R, 2)
```

However, this R is not less than the identity matrix
```{r}
eigen(R - diag(ncol(R)))$values
```

What are the eigenvalues of R?
```{r}
plot(eigen(R)$values)
```




```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
