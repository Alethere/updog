Description: Implements empirical Bayes approaches to genotype
       polyploids from next generation sequencing data while
       accounting for allelic bias, overdispersion, and sequencing
       error. The main function is `flexdog`, which allows the specification
       of many different genotype distributions. An experimental
       function that takes into account varying levels of relatedness
       is implemented in `mupdog`. Also provided are functions to
       simulate genotypes (`rgeno`) and read-counts (`rflexdog`), as well as
       functions to calculate oracle genotyping error rates (`oracle_mis`) and
       correlation with the true genotypes (`oracle_cor`). These latter two
       functions are useful for read depth calculations. Run
       `browseVignettes(package = "updog")` in R for example usage.
