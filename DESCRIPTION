Description: Implements empirical Bayes approaches to genotype
       autopolyploids from next generation sequencing data while
       accounting for allelic bias, overdispersion, and sequencing
       error. The main function is flexdog, which allows the specification
       of many different genotype distributions. An experimental
       function that takes into account varying leves of relatedness
       is implemented in mupdog. Also provided are functions to 
       simulate genotypes (rgeno) and read-counts (rflexdog).
