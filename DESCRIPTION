Description: This package provides a suite of functions that generalize the
       updog approach to genotyping autopolyploids from next-generation
       sequencing data. This includes a function
       that accounts for the correlation between individuals' genotypes
       (mupdog) and a function that more flexibly models the genotype 
       distribution (flexdog).
